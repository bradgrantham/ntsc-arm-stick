# Introduction

I wired up a microcontroller on a protoboard to display video on a vintage CRT TV by racing the beam.  I reached the limit of what I could do comfortably on a protoboard, so I designed a PCB with the peripherals I thought I might need for a beefy version of the thing.

I call it Rocinante.

It's named after Don Quixote's horse in the novel by Miguel de Cervantes. In many ways, Rocinante is also Quixote's double: like Don Quixote, Rocinante is awkward, past his prime, and engaged in a task beyond his capacities.
