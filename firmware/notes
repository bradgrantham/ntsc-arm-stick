So I now remember sort of that the Mikro has its own bootloader (?)
which can only be used with the Mikro downloader EXE.  Does the
Mikro not expose BOOT0?  I had made my own board out of an unmodified
STM32 exposing BOOT0 on the crazy big protoboard.  I can downloading using
"make burn", which calls dfu-util.



Use bit-banding where single bit read-modify-write operations are used
    setting GPIO direction
    clearing/setting GPIO
