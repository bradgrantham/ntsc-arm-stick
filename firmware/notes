Rein it in... or not
    every video mode should have an aspect ratio, like pixel Y to X or some such
        4:3 aspect ratio (is that only for visible pixels?  Or for the entire clocked frame?)
    use aspect ratio in DrawFilledCircle
    set up MAX RES underscan mode

    serial should interrupt and fill a buffer like keyboard does
    setup a software interrupt for VBlank processing (e.g. update scanout stats, audio goop) and trigger it from row=262
    blue button kicks back to text mode
    audio
        22050Hz?  11025Hz?  8000Hz?
        write audio sample immediately on entry to line ISR?  Then calculate next one right after that, then do video calculation?
            Then audio resampling would happen at the line rate for whatever video mode is current...
        Do DMA at 22050 from double-buffered 512-byte buffers?  Could conflict with video but should be able to set priority lower.

    "Apps"
        "__attribute__((constructor))" works!  How many can I have?
        Apps should have some kind of heap for their use freed up before each app
            limit use by main as much as possible - mark heap with some kind of symbol
        Should have a POSIX harness for running and testing the apps
        Main has "applets" that it contains that do system things

    On a hunch that maybe AHB doesn't do uchar writes directly and
      instead fetched a long, masked, or'd, and wrote a long, I tried
      doing word writes to GPIOC->ODR from DMA.  This would
      have been very inconvenient (altering ALL of GPIOC at once) but
      also would have meant using much more memory (a uint32_t per
      sample even though only 8 bits are used).  It didn't help, and
      in fact seemed worse.  Color didn't lock, jitter seemed as
      bad as uchar, and fillRowBuffer took MUCH longer (like 50% of the ISR).
    Tried half transfer and circular DMA buffer instead of DBM.  No
      change.  I think this is expected - DBM and Circular are probably
      implemented with the same logic except Circular updates always
      from M0AR.

    Observations
        While playing the khan segment, I got 7 FIFO underruns.  But that was over the course of many seconds.
        Do I just have an electrical issue?  Like when enough of the chip fires at once, I get a brownout?
	    That would explain the noise while the CPU is operating.
	    The noise is just brightness variations and not loss of pixels or sync.

    VTOR - vector table TBLOFF
    putting VTOR in SRAM1 didn't do anything
    while(1) WFI nor WFE did anything

    observations
        Here's a mystery: the porch value is 0x50, and that's at one voltage.  If I fill the color image with 0x50, that shows a slightly different voltage.

4/9
    observations
        glitch happens on line proportional to work done for the line (for the next line?)
        on YIQ images, glitch happens at the same horizontal location (because YIQ work is constant length per line)
        on lines with no work at low clocks rates, perfect color lock.
        better at lower clocks, worse at higher clocks, so is there a glitch happening in the colorburst at higher clocks?  Earlier per frame?
        Almost EVERYTHING is in CCM RAM now, except for font.  Could maybe copy into CCM but getting tight on stack.
        Drawing lk.ppm, suddenly switches from red to green or green to blue, or about 90 degrees, implying one missed transfer.
            So the DMA couldn't get memory for N cycles?  Or the GPIO stalled long enough to miss?

    underscan rects
        one rect is 196, 830, 44, 236 (shorter but wider) - PROBABLY CHOOSE THIS ONE
            to be /4, use 196, 828, 44, 236
            636 by 192, 122112 pixels in frame, 15264 bytes at 1-bit monochrome
                Apple 2 560x192 DHGR would fit in here
            318 double pixels wide, 61056 pixels in frame
            159 quad pixels wide, 30528 pixels in frame
        one rect is 209, 819, 40, 244 (slightly narrower but taller)
            to be /4, use 208, 820, 40, 244
            612 by 204, 124848 pixels in frame, 15606 bytes at 1-bit monochrome
                could get by with 512 x 200 in this mode
                Apple 2 560x192 DHGR would fit in here
            306 double pixels wide, 62424 pixels in frame
            153 quad pixels wide, 31212 pixels in frame 
        to get to 640 for 80x8 font, could do 196, 832, 44, 236
            height of font has to also be 8 at 192 pixels tall (matches Apple 2)
    overscan rect is 167, 862, 27, 257
        to be /4, 164, 864, 27, 257
        700 x 230, 20125 bytes at 1-bit monochome
        350 double pixels wide, 80500 pixels in frame, would need to be 4-bit
        175 quad pixels wide, 40250 pixels in frame, could support 8 bit

    2x would be 1.5 nF

So I now remember sort of that the Mikro has its own bootloader (?)
which can only be used with the Mikro downloader EXE.  Does the
Mikro not expose BOOT0?  I had made my own board out of an unmodified
STM32 exposing BOOT0 on the crazy big protoboard.  I can downloading using
"make burn", which calls dfu-util.
