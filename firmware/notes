    interlaced?  Does there need to be a non-interlaced vs interlaced mode?
        let VideoMode handle it in width, height, and aspect
        Then rowNumber to FillRow functions sequential line number?  so lineNumber = 262 is half the end of even field, half the beginning of odd field?
            240P modes would render lineNumber for even field, lineNumber - 263 for odd field
            480i modes would calculate lineNumber * 2 as rowNumber for even field, or (lineNumber 263) * 2 + 1 as rowNumber for odd field
            line 263 through 264 are handled specially by rowFill (copying in half of the next line)x
    make a scrollback buffer (how to scroll back?)
    help and other output should be paged -

            interpolating, what?  RGB probably too slow - HSV?
        Look up texture?  May be too hard to do perspective correction?
    Add Floyd-Steinberg dithering to showimage - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering
    Should debug overlay XOR or just have black background?
    Should NTSC modes take an RGB and use some kind of optimized lookup of 4 pixels at a time?
        If DVD's really have 700 vertical lines resolution, what do they do when going to Composite?
    Regularize I/O, get keyboard and serial combined into one queue
        serial should interrupt and fill a buffer like keyboard does
        int InputGetChar(c);    // -1 if no key waiting, maybe support raw modes for PS/2
        int InputWaitChar(c);

    Add some things to scripting
        # run from a file
            will recursion work the way you've set it up?

        22050Hz?  11025Hz?  8000Hz?
        write audio sample immediately on entry to line ISR?  Then calculate next one right after that, then do video calculation?
            Then audio resampling would happen at the line rate for whatever video mode is current...
        Do DMA at 22050 from double-buffered 512-byte buffers?  Could conflict with video but should be able to set priority lower.
        stereo audio output?
        1/8inch jack audio input can decode WeFAX or MFSK
    PS/2 mouse?
    "Apps"
        Apps should have some kind of heap for their use freed up before each app
            limit use by main as much as possible - mark heap with some kind of symbol?
        Should have a POSIX harness for running and testing the apps

    Wrap up


4/13
    On a hunch that maybe AHB doesn't do uchar writes directly and
      instead fetched a long, masked, or'd, and wrote a long, I tried
      doing word writes to GPIOC->ODR from DMA.  This would
      have been very inconvenient (altering ALL of GPIOC at once) but
      also would have meant using much more memory (a uint32_t per
      sample even though only 8 bits are used).  It didn't help, and
      in fact seemed worse.  Color didn't lock, jitter seemed as
      bad as uchar, and fillRowBuffer took MUCH longer (like 50% of the ISR).
    Tried half transfer and circular DMA buffer instead of DBM.  No
      change.  I think this is expected - DBM and Circular are probably
      implemented with the same logic except Circular updates always
      from M0AR.

    Observations
        While playing the khan segment, I got 7 FIFO underruns.  But that was over the course of many seconds.
        Do I just have an electrical issue?  Like when enough of the chip fires at once, I get a brownout?
	    That would explain the noise while the CPU is operating.
	    The noise is just brightness variations and not loss of pixels or sync.

    VTOR - vector table TBLOFF
    putting VTOR in SRAM1 didn't do anything
    while(1) WFI nor WFE did anything

4/10
    observations
        Here's a mystery: the porch value is 0x50, and that's at one voltage.  If I fill the color image with 0x50, that shows a slightly different voltage.

4/9
    observations
        glitch happens on line proportional to work done for the line (for the next line?)
        on YIQ images, glitch happens at the same horizontal location (because YIQ work is constant length per line)
        on lines with no work at low clocks rates, perfect color lock.
        better at lower clocks, worse at higher clocks, so is there a glitch happening in the colorburst at higher clocks?  Earlier per frame?
        Almost EVERYTHING is in CCM RAM now, except for font.  Could maybe copy into CCM but getting tight on stack.
        Drawing lk.ppm, suddenly switches from red to green or green to blue, or about 90 degrees, implying one missed transfer.
            So the DMA couldn't get memory for N cycles?  Or the GPIO stalled long enough to miss?

Video modes
    80x24 text at 8x16 is 640x384

    underscan rects
        one rect is 196, 830, 44, 236 (shorter but wider) - PROBABLY CHOOSE THIS ONE

            636 by 192, 122112 pixels in frame, 15264 bytes at 1-bit monochrome
                Apple 2 560x192 DHGR would fit in here
            318 double pixels wide, 61056 pixels in frame
            159 quad pixels wide, 30528 pixels in frame
        one rect is 209, 819, 40, 244 (slightly narrower but taller)
            to be /4, use 208, 820, 40, 244
            612 by 204, 124848 pixels in frame, 15606 bytes at 1-bit monochrome
                could get by with 512 x 200 in this mode
                Apple 2 560x192 DHGR would fit in here
            306 double pixels wide, 62424 pixels in frame
            153 quad pixels wide, 31212 pixels in frame 
        to get to 640 for 80x8 font, could do 196, 832, 44, 236
            height of font has to also be 8 at 192 pixels tall (matches Apple 2)
    overscan rect is 167, 862, 27, 257
        to be /4, 164, 864, 27, 257
        700 x 230, 20125 bytes at 1-bit monochome
        350 double pixels wide, 80500 pixels in frame, would need to be 4-bit
        175 quad pixels wide, 40250 pixels in frame, could support 8 bit

    2x would be 1.5 nF

So I now remember sort of that the Mikro has its own bootloader (?)
which can only be used with the Mikro downloader EXE.  Does the
Mikro not expose BOOT0?  I had made my own board out of an unmodified
STM32 exposing BOOT0 on the crazy big protoboard.  I can downloading using
"make burn", which calls dfu-util.

optimize Wolf Row more
    Measured taking between 86% and 92% of frame at 400 pixels
        at 200MHz I have HCLKs clocks per row.  Assume 10% on clearing pixels, 11488 HCLKs, so between 25 and 27 clocks per pixel; you're not going to get any faster.
    You should MIPmaps for quality but you're probably not thrashing cache, and that's going to slow you down.
    Maybe go to 2X pixels and 350 samples - can maybe MIPmap.
